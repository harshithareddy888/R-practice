# R-practice
The repo consists of COT (cleaning, organising and transforms files), bias function and Anseombe's quartet

# Bias Function 
Bias function finds the average amount that the actual outcome is greater than the predicted outcome
For an unbiased model, the bias function value should be close to 0, else it's not accurate
